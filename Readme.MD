Summary.
Plugin takes a bunch of selected assemblies, for example, beams or columns, or panels and exports them to IFC assembly by assembly. 
Plugin names a file according to the scheme: Assembly_Prefix.Assembly_Name.ifc
That is you select five assemblies, you get five ifc files in output directory.
